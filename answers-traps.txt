1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A: a2 holds the 13 in main's call to printf.

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
A: the call to f is in address 0x2e, and the call to g is in address 0x1a.

3. At what address is the function printf located?
A: 0x640

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A: 0x40

5. Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output?

A: He110 World

The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
A: i=0x726c6400, no need

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);

A: depends on what currently in a2
